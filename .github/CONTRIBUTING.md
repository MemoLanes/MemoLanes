# Contributing to MemoLanes

We welcome contributions to MemoLanes and appreciate your interest in improving our project. To ensure a smooth collaboration, we require all contributors to agree to our Copyright License Agreement (CLA).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

We ask MemoLanes contributors to agree to a Copyright License Agreement. This provides us with necessary permissions to use contributed code. For more information, see the FAQ below.

### FAQ

#### 1. What is a Copyright License Agreement (CLA) and why do I need one?

A Copyright License Agreement is a legal document in which you state you are entitled to contribute the code/documentation/translation to the project you're contributing to and are willing to have it used in distributions and derivative works. This means that should there be any kind of legal issue in the future as to the origins and ownership of any particular piece of code, then that project has the necessary forms on file from the contributor(s) saying they were permitted to make this contribution.

The CLA also ensures that once you have provided a contribution, you cannot try to withdraw permission for its use at a later date. People and companies can therefore use that software, confident that they will not be asked to stop using pieces of the code at a later date.

#### 2. How do I complete and submit the CLA?

The MemoLanes CLA for individual contributions can be found in this directory as `ha-cla-i-v1-memolanes.pdf`. If you're contributing through a pull request to MemoLanes project on GitHub, please read the CLA and indicate its acceptance by going back to GitHub and accepting electronically.

Please note that we currently only support individual contributions.

#### 3. How will my contributions to MemoLanes be used?

MemoLanes is an open-source project committed to providing our platform under open-source licenses. Through the license agreement, we ask you to grant us permission to use your contributions within MemoLanes and to continue to provide MemoLanes under open-source and commercial licenses and within proprietary products. This helps ensure the ongoing development, evolution and sustainability of MemoLanes.

As we do not ask for copyright assignment, you retain complete ownership of your contributions and have the same rights to use or license those contributions which you would have had without entering into a license agreement.

#### 4. If I do not own the copyright in the entire work of authorship?

If you do not own the copyright in the entire work of authorship, you can only contribute the work if the third-party works have been submitted separately by the upstream owner or under the upstream license.
